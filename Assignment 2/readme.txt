The wave and fistbump data were captured using the IMU program, systematically doing the motions and transferring the output to a csv file for future processing.
The audio data was captured with the BLE 33 program, with a similar output to the previous one, just for audio data, lowering the threshhold for the minumum sound level to make collection easier.
The image data was captured with the portenta using the data set collection tool. Allowing the helloworld program to be used to collect all 150 images of the fruits needed.
