The assignment was completed by looping through all the degrees of a circle.
Led was established as an output. The degrees were converted to radians, then put through a sin function.
The output of the sign function was then made positive by adding 1. Next, the value was multiplied by half of 255, the max LED brightness.
Finally, the LED was set to glow at the brightness of the calculated value, then waits 30ms.
