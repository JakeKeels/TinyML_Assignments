The LED flash is done by declaring the LED outputs, then looping through, and flashing the LED colors in a sort of order, by turning them on and off.
The camera assignment was done by setting the correct settings for the camera, first setting it to Grayscale,
next setting the scale of the image, then waiting a bit for the settings to go into place. Next, the program grabs the image from the Portenta, and displays it.
