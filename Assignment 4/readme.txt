Assignment 1 reused code to use the models from previous assignments. The data was flattened and a single rgb value was taken.
The array was put through the models.
Task 2 was difficult, keras and tensorflow were used to create a 3 layer neural network with an adam optimizer, and 3 outputs.
The outputs were shown.
Task 3 combined the two in the exact same manner, only using the class data.
